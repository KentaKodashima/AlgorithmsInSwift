 Doubly linked list
 A doubly linked list is simply a linked list
   in which nodes also contain a reference to the previous node.
 
 Strength:
  - Dequeuing an item is completed by just updating the nodeâ€™s previous and next pointers.
 
 Weakness:
  - Each element has to have extra storage for the forward and back reference which leads to high overhead.
  - every time you create a new element, it requires a relatively expensive dynamic allocation.
