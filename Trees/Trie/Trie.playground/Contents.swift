 Trie:
 The trie (pronounced as try) is a tree that specializes
  in storing data that can be represented as a collection, such as English words.
 Each character in a string is mapped to a node.
 The last node in each string is marked as a terminating node.
 
 Key points
  - Tries provide great performance metrics in regards to prefix matching.
  - Tries are relatively memory efficient since individual nodes
     can be shared between many different values.
    For example, "car," "carbs," and "care" can share the first three letters of the word.
 */

// words(matching:) will go through the collection of
//  strings and return the strings that match the prefix.
// If youâ€™re dealing with more than a few thousand words,
//  the time it takes to go through the words array will be unacceptable.
// The time complexity of words(matching:) is O(k*n),
//  where k is the longest string in the collection,
//  and n is the number of words you need to check.
//class EnglishDictionary {
//
//  private var words: [String]
//
//  func words(matching prefix: String) -> [String] {
//    return words.filter { $0.hasPrefix(prefix) }
//  }
//}

// Trie can be much more efficient in this case.
// Using tree, all you have to do is just to search each letter one by one.
